#+TITLE: wikigen

A static site generator for my wiki.

Built to support a directory structure of this type:

#+begin_src txt
wiki/
 - journals/
   - file.org
   - file2.org
 - pages/
   - file3.org
   - file3.org
#+end_src

Pass it the file path to 'wiki' and it'll generate:

wiki/
- public/
  - index.html
  - journals/
    - file.html
    - file2.html
  - pages/
    - file3.html
    - file3.html

with index.html having links to all of the pages in journals/ and pages/.

These directories should probably be created prior to avoid any strange errors.
