#+TITLE: This is a file with a title

the before title section
should be able to
[[https://google.com][handle all of the same things]] /that/ +the+ *body* _does_ with =emphasis=.

* TODO do this thing
this is some text that is left for the reader
** make sure it can parse nested headings
that should

mean something
these should show up in the field

[[file:file.org][tests linking to a local file]]

this test [[https://google.com][ensures that a link can be parsed out of line]]
 [[https://google.com][but does]] this work?


https://github.com makes sure a link works inline without the brackets, though I can just ignore this one if I really need to. it's bad practice
testing this text

** can it parse flavored text too?
it works well!! let's try some *bold*, /italicised/, +strikethrough+ and _underlined_ text.

for some reason,
newlines
aren't
being
rendered
properly.
** Lists
*** Unordered List
- This is item 1
- This is item 2
- This is item 3
*** Ordered Lists
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
*** name -> definition lists
- name 1 :: Definition 1
- name 2 ::  def 2

** Code in markup
#+BEGIN_SRC python
def __main__():
  print("testing some code!")
#+END_SRC

* What I should be handling
- Proper parsing of lists
- Fixing inline links
- Adding support for key :: value lists
- Image support
- Code blocks
- Proper line break support (not sure where this goes???)
- Displaying some time information
* What I'm not handling
** [[https://github.com][links in titles]]
These don't look good in articles and are a pain to deal with.
I should explicitly blacklist them.
** Links inline without brackets
I like that it blacklists these because it prevents laziness.
My website will break if these are found, so I have to /at least/ title links.
** TODO todo keywords
I'm not sure how I should handle these. Maybe I should omit everything without a DONE tag from the results? I think they should be used somehow to allow for partial drafts...

* these
* are
* lines

* to
* extend
* the
* length
* of
* the
* file
