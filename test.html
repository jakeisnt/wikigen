The attack of the Rohirrim        2. Eowyn&#39;s fight with the witch king + this was already my favorite scene in the book + I really like Miranda Otto.        3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas<ul><li>on DVD only</li></ul>           He makes a really funny face when it happens.        But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.        Important actors in this film are:<ul><li>Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo</li></ul><ul><li>Sean Astin :: He plays Sam, Frodo&#39;s friend.  I still remember</li></ul>          him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.</div></body></html>
